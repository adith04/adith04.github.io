                                    <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">
                                        The number of fatal injuries on active construction sites has risen by nearly 90 percent in the last three years and our company 
                                        is not immune. The four most common workplace hazards are falls, electrocutions, struck by and caught by accidents that constitute 
                                        over 60 percent of such injuries. This project provides a solution that aims to improve worker awareness and company profits by 
                                        reliably notifying workers of their proximity to potential hazards and active machinery. For our project we would like to develop 
                                        a system that combines image processing and point-cloud based computer vision methods in order to track the movement of workers 
                                        around the construction site and warn them of entering potentially dangerous regions. We would target the most common construction 
                                        site hazards, namely: workers falling and being struck by objects. With this technology, our company will be able to easily identify 
                                        the hazardous areas on our construction sites and prevent some of the most fatal accidents that we see every year.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                        For the design of the project, Our method is composed of 5 main steps. The first is to preprocess our worksite by selecting four fixed 
                                        points in the cameras field of view. This allows us account for the unique perspective of our camera and generate the respective 
                                        transformation matrix. Next, we read our video stream, and divide it into individual frames that You only look once (YOLO) can process. 
                                        Applying YOLO allows us to identify workers in each image, and using the outputted bounding box, we can map worker positions using our 
                                        previously defined transformation. Finally, we generate a map of worker positions for each frame and stitch that back together to form 
                                        an output video.  
                                    <br/>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                                        <span class="image center"><img src="img/yolo.webp" width="200" height="300" /> </span>
                                    </div>
                                    <br/>
                                        Given a video stream of our worksite, we need a way to map worker positions in the image, to worker positions in space. To do this we 
                                        rely on the fact that the camera’s position on the construction site is fixed and given 4 known positions we can generate a transformation 
                                        that maps pixel values to world coordinate values. This works because we assume all of the workers are on the same plane, implying that 
                                        their height is the same all times. So as you can see above, x, y are world coordinates and u and v are pixel coordinates. 
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                        After that we run YOLO on each of our frames, were given the pixels value for the center of the bounding box, and its dimensions. By 
                                        averaging the bottom of our bounding box, we can find a pixel representation of each worker’s position in each frame. We transform those 
                                        pixel values into world coordinates, using the matrix we found earlier. To generate our output video, we scale our world coordinate 
                                        positions by the size our output frame and boundary. We then stitch together each frame to create an animation. With our predefined 
                                        areas, we can accurately classify workers in danger areas.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                        The project was able to successfully	track the location of the workers and plot their location on the bird-eyes view. We were able 
                                        to track multiple bodies simultaneously and track their locations accurately. This was achieved with the use of just one camera.

                                        Each year there is a new company that is working on creating a new autonomous car that will be 
                                        able to operate without the input of humans. This current market share of this is $ 22.22 Billion 
                                        (2021) and is expected to increase to $75.95 Billion (2027). All major tech companies like Google, 
                                        Apple, Tesla and Microsoft are working on autonomous cars spending Billions on it. This is clearly 
                                        the future and this project hopes to tap into a small part of autonomous cars. This project works 
                                        on creating a simulation of an autonomous buggy going around the track (CMU's Buggy Track) in the 
                                        most optimal path possible, with the use of a lateral and longitudinal controller. 
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                        The design of the project was done using Webots as a simulator with a help of a tractor to indicate 
                                        the buggy that is moving. For the design of the controller I used a bicycle model for the study of 
                                        the vehicle dynamics. The controller was two part, Longitudinal and Lateral. The longitudinal 
                                        controller is based GPS coordinates of the track and the acceleration is calculated based on the 
                                        closest node. This was done with the information of the track layout, with the buggy accelerating 
                                        in straight parts of the track and the buggy slowing down in the turns. The lateral controller on 
                                        the other hand was based on 5 different iterations:
                                        <ol type="1">
                                            <li>PID Controller</li>
                                            <li>State Feedback Controller</li>
                                            <li>LQR Controller</li>
                                            <li>MPC Controller</li>
                                            <li>EKF SLAM</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    
                                    
                                        To evaluate the performance of the simulation model, I tested the model on the buggy track 
                                        around CMU, and evaluated the time to complete the track and the deviation from the main path. 
                                        The model was able to complete the track in less than 120 seconds and had an average deviation 
                                        less than 3 meters from the optimal track path. This proved to work substantially better than the 
                                        real world buggy that are raced every year around CMU.                                     
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                        This project was successfully able to design a controller for a tractor to autonomously complete 
                                        the buggy track around CMU in a time of less than 120 seconds and have a minimum deviation of less 
                                        than 3 meters. It was able to implement different iterations of the lateral controller to clear the 
                                        performance evaluations.

                                        Space travel is going through a revolution for the first time since the space race in 60s. There is a 
                                        large push towards travel to mars with companies like NASA, SpaceX and ISRO sending satellites and rockets
                                        to Mars. NASA launched 5 rovers to Mars with the latest Perseverance and Curiosity costing $2.4 Billion
                                        and $2.5 Billion respectively. The research on Mars Rovers is at all time high right now. This project 
                                        works on designing a Mars Rover to autonomously traverse a rugged terrain and complete tasks.

                                        design and models. This was followed by designing the rover’s different components:

                                        The chassis of the rover was inspired by the Curiosity rover by NASA. It was tasked with housing 
                                        the internal computers, electronics and batteries. The chassis is tasked to keep the internal 
                                        components safe when traversing the rugged terrain. It is made out of aluminum 6000 series to 
                                        get a high strength for low weight.

                                        Rocker Bogie Mechanism - 
                                        <br/>
                                        The rover to remain stable and not fail when subjected to harsh environments, requires a differential 
                                        to distribute the load applied on the rover. The rover employs a rocker bogie mechanism in the 
                                        structures that connect the wheels to the chassis. This helps reducing the shock on the body, by 
                                        acting like a suspension to dampen the impact on the rover. The bar differential in the rover is used 
                                        to transfer the shock passing through the body to a stable part of the rover, so that it does not 
                                        affect delicate parts.

                                        The global CubeSat market is projected to grow from USD 152 million in 2018 to USD 375 million by 
                                        2023, at a CAGR of 19.87% from 2018 to 2023. Having initially been developed as educational tools, 
                                        CubeSats are increasingly being put to active use in orbit for technology demonstration, scientific 
                                        studies, and even commercial purposes. And just like typical satellites, they are custom built to 
                                        fulfill the specific requirements of their mission. CubeSats are now commonly used in low Earth orbit 
                                        for applications such as remote sensing and communications. Nitinol wires were used for the shape 
                                        memory alloy actuation system. Shape Memory Alloys exhibit a property called Shape Memory Effect. 
                                        The shape memory effect (SME) is a phenomenon, in which a material recovers to its original size and 
                                        shape when heated above a certain characteristic transformation temperature. This project is to design 
                                        a nitinol based actuator for the deployment of solar panels in CubSats.  
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                        The design of the model started with selection of the actuator. We tried and tested many different 
                                        types of actuator, such as electric and hydraulic. These were eliminated due to the low power output, 
                                        but high mass. Finally, we settled on the nitinol actuator to be used in the solar panels. Following 
                                        this, we worked on designing the actuator and the housing on the satellite. As CubSats are smaller 
                                        in size compared to regular satellites, the housing had to placed in a way that does not take too 
                                        much space on the inside, but also have a large enough range of motion. Once the design was finalized, 
                                        the prototyping started. We started by training the nitinol wire to return back to the desired shape. 
                                        This was done by heating the wire to high temperatures and then quenching it. A model of a CubSat was 
                                        made with wood and the nitinol was controlled using an Arduino board. The entire setup was made to 
                                        move a solar panel on command from a user.                                      
                                    <br/>

                                    <br/>
                                        The prototype was tested in different conditions and made to work with different types of solar 
                                        panels. The model tested well in the all the tests and was able to generate the required torque to 
                                        actuate the panel, while using significantly less energy compared the other types of actuators present.

                                        This project was successful in creating an actuator for the solar panels in a CubSat. The nitinol 
                                        actuator was able to generate enough torque to move the panel, while at the same time, being lighter 
                                        and consume lesser energy than the conventional actuators.
